AgfeoRuby
=========

Accessing functions of the Agfeo TK Suite Server from Ruby.


I'm in no way connected with Agfeo. I just own a AS200IT currently running Firmware V8.2k with a LAN-Modul 510 in it and try to integrate it a little deeper into our infrastrucutre.

The first UseCase is the ability of Autodial a number from within our Intranet on the Desk-Phone.
